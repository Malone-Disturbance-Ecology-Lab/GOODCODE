# Key Points: 

1. Conducting reproducible research is a strong indicator to fellow researchers of rigor,
trustworthiness, and transparency in scientific research
Reproducible research allows others to learn from your work.
2.  Reproducible research increases paper citation rates (Piwowar et al. 2007, McKiernan et al.
2016) and allows other researchers to cite code and data in addition to publications. 
3. Reproducible research allows others to understand and reproduce a researcherâ€™s work.
4. Reproducible research enables quick reconfiguration of previously conducted research tasks
so that new projects that require similar tasks become much simpler and easier
