# GOODCODE

Book: <https://bookdown.org/content/d1e53ac9-28ce-472f-bc2c-f499f18264a3/func.html>

When coding for research, best practices include using descriptive names for functions and variables, keeping functions concise and focused on a single task, avoiding code repetition by utilizing reusable functions (DRY principle), documenting the purpose of each function with clear comments, and ensuring consistent formatting and indentation for readability; all aimed at making your code easier to understand, maintain, and reproduce for future research endeavors. 
 
## Key points to remember:

# 1. Meaningful names:
Choose function and variable names that reflect their purpose, making it intuitive to understand what each part of the code does. 
# 2. Small, focused functions:
Break down complex tasks into smaller, well-defined functions that each handle a specific operation. 
# 3. DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):
Identify and eliminate redundant code by creating reusable functions that can be called in multiple places. 
# 4. Comments:
Add clear and concise comments to explain the logic behind complex functions, especially when dealing with non-standard algorithms or data manipulation. 
# 5. Consistent formatting:
Adhere to a consistent indentation and coding style for better readability. 
# 6. Version control:
Utilize a version control system like Git to track changes in your code and collaborate effectively with other researchers. 
Specific examples of good function practices in research coding:
# 7. Data cleaning functions:
Create dedicated functions for tasks like handling missing values, outlier detection, and data type conversions. 
# 8. Statistical analysis functions:
Wrap statistical calculations into functions with clear parameter names (e.g., "calculate_mean", "perform_anova"). 
# 9. Visualization functions:
Design functions to generate specific types of plots (e.g., "plot_histogram", "create_scatterplot"). 
# 10. Model training functions:
Encapsulate model training processes into functions with parameters for hyperparameter tuning.
